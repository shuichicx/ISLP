## Question 1
Draw an example (of your own invention) of a partition of two- dimensional feature space that could result from recursive binary splitting. Your example should contain at least six regions. Draw a decision tree corresponding to this partition. Be sure to label all as- pects of your figures, including the regions R1, R2, . . ., the cutpoints t1,t2,..., and so forth.

## Question 2
It is mentioned in Section 8.2.3 that boosting using depth-one trees (or stumps) leads to an additive model: that is, a model of the form

$$ f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(X_j) $$

Explain why this is the case. You can begin with (8.12) in
Algorithm 8.2.

### Answer
Recall the equation (8.12)

$$ \hat{f}(x) = \sum_{b=1}^B \lambda \hat{f}^b(x) \tag{8.12} $$

Depth-one trees (Decision stumps) make predictions based on a single feature and a treshold value. According to this information, a each decision stumps can only capture a limited and local relationship between a single feature and the target value. By combining each of these decision stumps, we can obtain a single decision tree that has a better performance on all the dataset.

## Question 3
Consider the Gini index, classification error, and entropy in a simple classification setting with two classes. Create a single plot that dis- plays each of these quantities as a function of $\hat{p}_{m1}$. The x-axis should display $\hat{p}_{m1}$, ranging from 0 to 1, and the y-axis should display the value of the Gini index, classification error, and entropy.

Hint: In a setting with two classes, $\hat{p}_{m1} = 1 âˆ’ \hat{p}_{m2}$. You could make this plot by hand, but it will be much easier to make in R.

## Question 4
This question relates to the plots in Figure 8.14.

(a) Sketch the tree corresponding to the partition of the predictor space illustrated in the left-hand panel of Figure 8.14. The numbers inside the boxes indicate the mean of Y within each region.

(b) Create a diagram similar to the left-hand panel of Figure 8.14, using the tree illustrated in the right-hand panel of the same figure. You should divide up the predictor space into the correct regions, and indicate the mean for each region.

## Question 5

Suppose we produce ten bootstrapped samples from a data set containing red and green classes. We then apply a classification tree to each bootstrapped sample and, for a specific value of X, produce 10 estimates of P(Class is Red|X):

$$ 0.1,0.15,0.2,0.2,0.55,0.6,0.6,0.65,0.7, \text{and} \ 0.75. $$

There are two common ways to combine these results together into a single class prediction. One is the majority vote approach discussed in this chapter. The second approach is to classify based on the average probability. In this example, what is the final classification under each of these two approaches?

### Answer

In the majority vote approach, we determine the class with the highest number of estimations. In the given estimation results, the majority class is the red class, as it has more than 0.5 probability in 6 estimations. Therefore, we can conclude that the final classification of the model is the red class.

In the average probability approach, we compute the average probability of the given estimation values. In this case, the average probability of the class being red is calculated as:

$$ \frac{1}{n}\sum P(\text{Class is Red} | X) = 0.45. $$

According to the average probability approach, the final classification of the model is determined based on this average probability. In this case, since the average probability is 0.45, we classify the instance as the green class.

## Question 6

Provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm that is used to fit a regression tree.

### Answer

We begin with the entire dataset and use the recursive binary splitting method for branching. This algorithm aims to find the best split at each iteration that results in the greatest improvement in performance. We consider all predictors, denoted as $X_1, X_2, ..., X_p$, and all possible values of cutpoints $s$ for each predictor. The split that minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS) is selected:

$$\sum_{i:x_i \in R_1(j,s)} (y_i - \hat{y}_{R1})^2 + \sum_{i:x_i \in R_2(j,s)} (y_i - \hat{y}_{R2})^2$$

After each iteration, we proceed further by considering the next steps of the branches created in the previous steps. The algorithm continues until it meets the stopping criterion. Once the stopping criterion is met, the branching process finishes, and the model is ready to make predictions based on the results in the terminal nodes.
